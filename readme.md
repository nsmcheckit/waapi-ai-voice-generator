# Text To Speech From Wwise
## Overview

This samples demonstrates how to generate WAV files from a text-to-speech from Wwise directly.

Demonstrates:

- WAAPI [ak.wwise.ui.getSelectedObjects](https://www.audiokinetic.com/library/edge/?source=SDK&id=ak__wwise__ui__getselectedobjects.html)
- WAAPI [ak.wwise.core.audio.import](https://www.audiokinetic.com/library/edge/?source=SDK&id=ak__wwise__core__audio__import.html)
- Text to Speech using Windows Powershell
- Wwise External Tools

## Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Use the LTS version
1. [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Windows operating system 
1. Windows Powershell (comes with Windows 10)

## Setup

It works best with Visual Studio Code. Run the following commands.

Install dependencies:

    npm install

Build Typescript:

    npm run build

## Execution

First, ensure WAAPI is enabled in Wwise:
 - menu **Project/Preferences**
 - Check **Enable Wwise Authoring API**
 - Click **OK**
 - Restart Wwise

Then, open a Wwise Project.

### Adding this script as an external editor

In Wwise:
1. Open menu: **Project > User Preferences**
1. In the **External Editors**, click **Add...**
1. Browse for the `text-to-speech.cmd` file in this directory
1. Click **OK**

### Executing

1. Create a **Sound Voice** object
1. Insert text in the **Notes** field
1. Right-click the **Sound Voice** object, and use the external editor text-to-speech

## How it works

The source code is located in [index.ts](index.ts). 

This script is executed as an external editor in Wwise from the current selection. It will retrieve the selection from WAAPI and generate a WAV file for each selected Sound objects using Windows text to speech. The WAV files will be automatically imported in the project with WAAPI.
